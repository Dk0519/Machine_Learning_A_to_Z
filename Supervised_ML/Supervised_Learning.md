# 🧠 Supervised Machine Learning

## 🔍 Detailed Definition

**Supervised Machine Learning** is a type of machine learning where an algorithm is trained using **labeled data**. Each data point in the training set consists of an **input** (features) and a corresponding **correct output** (label). The model learns a mapping function from inputs to outputs and uses it to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

### 📌 Characteristics:
- **Labeled Dataset**: Training data includes correct answers.
- **Learning Objective**: Minimize the difference between predicted and actual output.
- **Output**: Can be either a **category** (classification) or a **number** (regression).

### 🧠 Formal Representation

Let the training dataset be:

\[
D = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)\}
\]

- `x_i` = input features  
- `y_i` = known output  
- Goal: Learn a function `f(x) ≈ y`

## 📘 Example: Predicting Exam Scores

| Hours Studied (X) | Exam Score (Y) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 5                 | 80             |
| 2                 | 45             |
| 9                 | 95             |

### ✅ Explanation:

1. **Objective**: Predict a student's score based on how many hours they study.
2. **Type of Learning**: Regression (output is a continuous value).
3. **Features (X)**: Hours studied.
4. **Labels (Y)**: Exam score.
5. **Training the Model**:  
   The algorithm finds a relationship like:

   \[
   \text{Score} = 10 \times (\text{Hours Studied}) + 30
   \]

6. **Using the Model**:  
   For a new input, e.g., `Hours Studied = 6`, the predicted score would be:

   \[
   \text{Predicted Score} = 10 \times 6 + 30 = 90
   \]

## 📦 How It Works

In supervised learning, the model receives data with both inputs and outputs. It tries to learn the mapping function `f: X → Y` that minimizes prediction errors on future data.
